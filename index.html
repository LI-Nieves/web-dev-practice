     Basic website sections:

                big strip across the top with a heading, logo, etc.
                <header>
            navigation bar
                links to site's main sections
                usually presented as a menu or something
                <nav>
            main content
                big area in center with most of the content
                <main>, with subsections like <article>, <section>, and <div>
            sidebar
                peripheral info
                <aside>, normally placed inside main
            footer
                strip across the bottom with fine print, contact, etc.

    Other elements:
        <span> 
            Inline non-semantic element
            should only use if you can't think of a better semantic text element to wrap your content, or don't want to add any specific meaning.
            Example: editor's note
        <div>
            block level non-semantic element
            should only use if you can't think of a better semantic block element to use, or don't want to add any specific meaning
            Example: a shopping cart widget that you could choose to pull up at any point during your time on an e-commerce site
        <br>
            line break element
        <hr>
            shown as a horizontal rule
            creates a horizontal rule in the document that denotes a thematic change in the text
